1. Lexical Analysis
	First step: recognize words
		– Smallest unit above letters
	Lexical analyzer divides program text into “words” or “tokens”
2. Parsing
	Once words are understood, the next step is to understand sentence structure
	Parsing = Diagramming Sentences
		- The diagram is a tree

3. Semantic Analysis
	Once sentence structure is understood, we can try to understand “meaning”
		- But meaning is too hard for compilers
	Compilers perform limited semantic analysis to catch inconsistencies

	Compilers perform many semantic checks besides variable bindings
4. Optimization
	Akin to editing
		- Minimize reading time
		- Minimize items the reader must keep in short-term memory
	Automatically modify programs so that they
		- Run faster
		- Use less memory
		- In general, to conserve some resource
5. Code Generation
	Typically produces assembly code
	Generally a translation into another language
		- Analogous to human translation

## Intermediate Representations

Many compilers perform translations between successive intermediate languages
- All but first and last are intermediate representations (IR) internal to the compiler
IRs are generally ordered in descending level of abstraction
- Highest is source
- Lowest is assembly

IRs are useful because lower levels expose features hidden by higher levels
- registers
- memory layout
- raw pointers
- etc

But lower levels obscure high-level meaning
- Classes
- Higher-order functions
- Even loops…

## History of Ideas: Abstraction

- Abstraction = detached from concrete details
	- “Abstraction is selective ignorance” - Andrew Koenig
- Abstraction is necessary to build any complex system
	- The key is information hiding—expose only the essential
- Modes of abstraction
	- **Via languages/compilers:** High-level code, few machine dependencies
	- **Via functions and subroutines:** Abstract interface to behavior
	- **Via modules:** Export interfaces; hide implementation
	- **Via classes/abstract data types:** Bundle data with its operations


## History of Ideas: Types

- Originally, few types
	- FORTRAN: scalars, arrays
	- LISP: no static type distinctions
- Realization: Types help
	- Lets you to express abstraction
	- Lets the compiler report many frequent errors
	- Sometimes to the point that programs are guaranteed “safe”
	- Helps the compiler optimize your code
- More recently
	- Lots of interest in types
	- Experiments with various forms of parameterization
	- Best developed in functional programming


## History of Ideas: Reuse

- Reuse = exploit common patterns in software systems
	- Goal: mass-produced software components
	- Reuse is difficult
- Two popular approaches
	- Type parameterization (List(int), List(double))
	- Classes and inheritance: C++ derived classes
	- C++ and Java have both
- Inheritance allows
	- Specialization of existing abstraction
	- Extension, modification, and hidden behavior


# Lexical Analysis

What do we want to do? Example:

```C
if(i==j)
	z=0;
else
	z=1;
```

The input is just a string of characters:

```C
\tif (i == j)\n\t\tz = 0;\n\telse\n\t\tz = 1;
```

Goal: Partition input string into substrings
- Where the substrings are called tokens

## Token

A token class corresponds to a set of strings
Examples:
- Identifier: strings of letters or digits, starting with a letter
- Integer: a non-empty string of digits
- Keyword: “else” or “if” or “begin” or
- Whitespace: a non-empty sequence of blanks, newlines, and tabs

Lexical analysis produces a stream of tokens which is input to the parser
Parser relies on token distinctions
- An identifier is treated differently than a keyword


## Designing a Lexical Analyzer

1. Define a finite set of tokens
	- Tokens describe all items of interest
		- Identifiers, integers, keywords
	- Choice of tokens depends on
		- language
		- design of parser
>[!example]
>Recall 
>```
>\tif (i == j)\n\t\tz = 0;\n\telse\n\t\tz = 1;
>```
>Useful tokens for this expression:
>	`Integer, Keyword, Relation, Identifier, Whitespace, (, ), , ;`

2. Describe which strings belong to each token
Recall:
-  Identifier: strings of letters or digits, starting with a letter
- Integer: a non-empty string of digits
- Keyword: “else” or “if” or “begin” or …
-  Whitespace: a non-empty sequence of blanks, newlines, and tabs

An implementation must do two things:
- Classify each substring as a token
- Return the value or lexeme (value) of the token
	- The lexeme is the actual substring
	-  From the set of substrings that make up the token
The lexer thus returns token-lexeme pairs
- And potentially also line numbers, file names, etc. to improve later error messages

The lexer usually discards “uninteresting” tokens that don’t contribute to parsing
- Examples: Whitespace, Comments


## Lexical Analysis in FORTRAN

FORTRAN rule: Whitespace is insignificant
- E.g., `VAR1` is the same as `VA R1`

Historical footnote: FORTRAN Whitespace rule motivated by inaccuracy of punch card operators

>[!example]
>
>```fortran
>DO 5 I = 1,25
>```
>This is a fortran loop. The first token is `Do
>
>```fortran
>DO 5 I = 1.25
>```
>This is a assignment. The first toekn is `DO5I`

Two important points:
1. The goal is to partition the string. This is implemented by reading left-to-right, recognizing one token at a time
2. “Lookahead” may be required to decide where one token ends and the next token begins


## Lexical Analysis in C++

Unfortunately, the problems continue today
C++ template syntax:

```C++
Foo<Bar>
```

C++ stream syntax:

```C++
cin >> var;
```

But there is a conflict with nested templates:

```C++
Foo<Bar<Bazz>>
```


We still need
-  A way to describe the lexemes of each token
- A way to resolve ambiguities
	- Is if two variables i and f?
	- Is == two equal signs = =?

There are several formalisms for specifying tokens
Regular languages are the most popular
- Simple and useful theory
- Easy to understand
- Efficient implementations

Def. Let **alphabet** Σ be a set of characters. 
A **language** over Σ is a set of strings of  **characters** drawn from Σ.
